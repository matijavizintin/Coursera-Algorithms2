    /**
     * This algorithm was fixed with a custom Substring class to be memory effective. Substring doesn't create new
     * strings as String.substring does but instead allocated only 2 new integers (pointers) to the beginning and
     * and of the new substring as the previous java implementation did. The original string is only passed as a
     * reference consuming barely 8 bytes of memory. All operations are constant time as they should be, except
     * obviously asString() that creates a new string.
     *
     * ORIGINAL COMMENT:
     * This algorithm consumes GIGANTIC amounts of memory. Example: a string with 120k characters consumed more than
     * 10GB of memory!!! This is due to a change in jdk7v06 of String.substring method. From that version on it makes
     * a copy of the underlying array of characters and doesn't reuse the original array.
